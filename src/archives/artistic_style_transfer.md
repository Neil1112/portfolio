# Artistic Style Transfer Project

## Overview

The Artistic Style Transfer project aims to create visually appealing and artistic images by applying the style of a famous painting to a photograph. This project leverages the power of neural networks, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to capture the unique brushwork, colors, and patterns of the selected art style and then apply it to user-provided photos.

## Description

Artistic style transfer is an exciting application of deep learning and computer vision that enables us to combine the content of one image with the style of another. The key idea is to define a content loss and a style loss based on the features extracted by the pre-trained CNN. By minimizing these losses, the algorithm can generate an image that captures the content of the input photo while adopting the stylistic features of the chosen artwork.

## Implementation

Here's a simplified example of how artistic style transfer could be implemented using Python and libraries like TensorFlow and Keras:

```python
# Load the pre-trained VGG19 model
model = VGG19(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)

# Get the symbolic outputs of each "key" layer (we gave them unique names).
outputs_dict = dict([(layer.name, layer.output) for layer in model.layers])

# Set up a model that returns the activation values for every layer in
# VGG19 (as a dict).
feature_extractor = keras.Model(inputs=model.inputs, outputs=outputs_dict)

# Load the content and style images
content_image = load_img(content_image_path, target_size=img_size)
style_image = load_img(style_image_path, target_size=img_size)

# Preprocess the input images
content_image = preprocess_img(content_image)
style_image = preprocess_img(style_image)

# Compute the style features
style_features = feature_extractor(style_image)['block5_conv2']

# Compute the content features
content_features = feature_extractor(content_image)['block5_conv2']

# Initialize the generated image with random noise
generated_image = tf.Variable(content_image)

# Create an optimizer
optimizer = tf.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.02, beta_1=0.99, epsilon=1e-1)

# For each iteration, calculate the loss and update the generated image
for _ in range(num_iterations):
    compute_loss_and_grads(generated_image, content_features, style_features)
    optimizer.apply_gradients([(grads, generated_image)])
    generated_image.assign(clip_0_1(generated_image))
```
